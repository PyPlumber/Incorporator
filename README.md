The Incorporator is a Super Class meant to convert data records into instances of a Subclass.

The algorithm will:
  Use PANDAS to parse JSON into DataFrames for manipulation.
  
  Create a Class dictionary for a given unique data record index/key/field
  
  Create a Class for the data records
  
  Dynamically name Class attributes for the incoming field names
  
  Convert values to primitive Python Classes or Dictionary pointers
  
  Change field/attribute field names
  

  Tests were done using the Rick and Morty API.
